# Wayland

A session can be a Wayland one: `--wayland` runs the program under a
headless sway instead of Xvfb, and `--xwayland` adds an X server inside
it, for X clients running on a Wayland desktop the way they do on a real
one. Everything else stays: the scratch home, the private bus, the waits,
the pictures, the cleanup.

This is the plan for it, and where it has got to.

## Why sway

Everything shotbox does to a display, it has to be able to do from a
client, with no GPU and no seat:

| Needs | Xvfb (now) | headless sway | headless Mutter |
|---|---|---|---|
| A private display, no GPU, no seat | yes | yes (`WLR_BACKENDS=headless`) | yes |
| The same pixels every run | yes | yes, with the pixman renderer | not checked |
| Pictures | `import` | wlr-screencopy (`grim`) | none for clients: D-Bus and PipeWire |
| Windows, by name, and where | `xwininfo` | its IPC socket: title, app id, rect | none for clients |
| Keys and pointer | XTEST | the virtual keyboard and pointer protocols | D-Bus remote desktop, over PipeWire |

In a spike (Debian testing, sway 1.12, a GTK 4 window), sway came up
headless with the pixman renderer, reported the window's title, app id,
geometry and focus over IPC, `grim` took the same bytes twice, whole and
by region, and text typed with `wtype` reached the window, less its first
character (see phase 2).

Mutter, headless, offers clients none of the three: no capture, no input
and no window list, only D-Bus sessions that need PipeWire. GNOME Shell
itself is better shot the way neon-doll's `shoot-shell.sh` does it, with
an extension inside. Other wlroots compositors (cage, labwc) would fit
later behind the same code, since the protocols are the same.

## How it fits

`Screen` talks to the display through a backend, picked from the
session's environment:

- **X11** is today's code: `xwininfo` and `import` (x.py), XTEST (xtest.py).
- **Wayland** is new (wl.py):
  - windows come from sway's IPC socket, which speaks JSON over a Unix
    socket: a few lines of the standard library, no `swaymsg` or `jq`;
  - pictures come from `grim`, run through ImageMagick like the X ones,
    so the PNGs have no timestamps;
  - a `stable` wait's fingerprint is `grim` writing a PPM to a pipe;
- **Wayland input** is wlinput.py, a small Wayland client of our own for
  sway's virtual keyboard and pointer, the way xtest.py is for X: the
  keymap goes over as text in a memfd, passed with `sendmsg`.

The session, with `--wayland`:

- starts `sway -c CONFIG` with `WLR_BACKENDS=headless`,
  `WLR_RENDERER=pixman` and `WLR_LIBINPUT_NO_DEVICES=1`, its sockets in
  the session's own `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`;
- writes the config: the output at `--screen`'s size, no borders, no
  gaps, and every window floating at 0,0 at the size it asks for, the
  way an X client comes up on Xvfb with no window manager;
- waits for sway to answer on its IPC socket (it has nothing like Xvfb's
  `-displayfd`);
- sets `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `SWAYSOCK`, `XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland` and
  `GDK_BACKEND=wayland`, and no `DISPLAY`.

With `--xwayland`, sway starts Xwayland straight away (`xwayland force`)
and the session sets `DISPLAY` to it too, which sway reports to a command
it runs. GTK still picks Wayland; a program that only speaks X, or one
told to (`--env GDK_BACKEND=x11`), is an X client of Xwayland, as on a
desktop. sway's IPC lists X windows beside Wayland ones, so finding,
waiting on and taking a picture of one is the same.

Xwayland is asked for rather than always there: it's a second server to
start and stop, and a session without it can't have a program quietly
fall back to X.

## What differs from X11

- **The pictures aren't X11's.** GTK draws its own decorations on
  Wayland, with rounded corners and, where there's room, a shadow. A
  committed picture belongs to one backend.
- **Window geometry** is sway's rect for the window, which leaves the
  shadow out, so a point inside a window is where it would be on X11.
- **Xwayland isn't Xvfb either.** An X client there has no XSETTINGS to
  read, so GTK falls back to 96 dpi and draws its text smaller than the
  same program does as a Wayland client, as it would on a desktop.
- **A window's name** is its title, as on X11, and `app=RE` matches its
  app id: a Wayland window's `app_id`, or an X one's `WM_CLASS` under
  Xwayland, the same as on Xvfb.

## Phases

1. **Sessions, pictures and waits.** `--wayland` and `--xwayland` for
   `run`, `shoot` and `term` (VTE is at home on Wayland, so `term` came
   along); windows by name; `capture`, `shoot --window/--crop`, `stable`
   waits and failure pictures; the Python API choosing its backend;
   tests that skip without sway, `grim` and Xwayland, and CI that
   installs them. *Done.*
2. **Input.** Keys, text, clicks, moves, drags and `park` over the
   virtual keyboard and pointer protocols, on one connection kept for
   the session, reaching Xwayland's X clients too. *Done.*

   The spike lost the first key `wtype` sent, so the keyboard is made
   with one fixed keymap holding every key shotbox can press, each
   symbol on a key of its own (no Shift, no keymap changes), and a new
   keyboard presses a key with no symbol first and waits a moment. Over
   about 150 runs of typing into a GTK 4 entry, cold and under load, the
   shipped keyboard lost nothing, and nor did one without the blank key
   or the wait; one variant (the blank key without the wait) lost text
   twice early on and never again. What wtype hit wasn't pinned down.
   The tests type through twenty keyboards, one per key, and fail on a
   missing one.
3. **The rest.** Matching on app id (`app=RE`, on X11 too), and a
   README section of its own. *Done.*
4. **Using it.** neon-doll's `cosmic-shoot.sh` already runs COSMIC's
   compositor nested in a headless sway and takes it with `grim`; it
   becomes a `shotbox run --wayland`.

## Needs

`sway` and `grim` for `--wayland`, and `Xwayland` for `--xwayland`. On
Debian and Ubuntu: `sudo apt install sway grim xwayland`. Nothing else;
X11 sessions need none of them.
