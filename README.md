# shotbox

Reproducible screenshots of real programs, taken where they can't touch your
desktop.

`shotbox shoot` starts a program on a private X display, with its own D-Bus
and a scratch home, waits until it's actually ready, takes the picture, and
cleans up. Run it twice and you get the same bytes. Nothing it runs can
reach your session: no stray windows on your screen, no settings changed, no
profiles or caches written in your home.

```
shotbox shoot editor.png --window 'Text Editor' -- gnome-text-editor notes.md
```

## Why

Screenshots for a README, a theme preview, or a check that a UI still looks
right all want the same things, and every project was growing its own copy:

- **Sealed.** The environment is rebuilt from an allowlist, not scrubbed from
  a denylist, so nothing leaks in by accident. `DISPLAY`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`
  and your session bus are gone; `HOME` and every XDG directory are a scratch
  dir. The bus has nothing activatable on it, so no gvfs, dconf or portals
  start behind your back. Settings are in-memory, so apps come up with their
  own defaults, not yours.
- **Ready, not slept.** Waits are for things: a window mapped, a port open, a
  file written, text on a terminal's screen, or the picture holding still.
  No `sleep 6` and hope.
- **Deterministic.** X11 on Xvfb, GTK's software renderer, `LANG=C.UTF-8`,
  `TZ=UTC`, a cursor that doesn't blink (GTK's text caret included, and GTK's
  animations off), and PNGs with no timestamps in them.
- **Cleaned up.** Every program runs in its own process group, and the group
  is killed on the way out: signalling a wrapper script alone leaves its
  children running.

## Install

Needs `Xvfb`, `xauth`, `dbus-daemon`, ImageMagick and `xwininfo`; for
`shotbox term`, PyGObject with VTE (`gir1.2-vte-2.91`). On Debian:

```
sudo apt install xvfb xauth dbus-daemon imagemagick x11-utils gir1.2-vte-2.91
ln -s "$PWD/bin/shotbox" ~/.local/bin/shotbox
```

No Python packages: it's the standard library and those tools. Wayland
sessions need more; see [Wayland](#wayland).

## Commands

**`shotbox shoot OUT.png [options] -- COMMAND...`** starts the command in a
sealed session, waits, takes the picture and stops everything.

- `--window RE` takes that window (its title, a regex matched in full)
  rather than the whole display, and waits for it to appear. `app=RE`
  matches its app id instead: a Wayland window's `app_id`, or an X
  window's `WM_CLASS`, instance or class. Every `--window` and every
  `window` wait takes either.
- `--wait window:RE|port:N|file:PATH|ready|stable[:SECS]` waits for more
  (repeatable, in order). `ready` is `$SHOTBOX_SCRATCH/ready` existing;
  `shotbox term` writes it. `stable` is the `--window` (or the whole display)
  looking the same for SECS (0.5): for a program with no other sign it's
  done drawing.
- `--park` moves the pointer out of the way first (see `shotbox park`).
- `--crop WxH+X+Y`, `--settle SECS` (0.3), `--timeout SECS` (30),
  `--log FILE` for the program's output. If a wait fails or the program
  dies, it says which, shows the program's last output, and leaves a
  picture of the screen as it was beside OUT, as `OUT-failed.png`
  (`--failed FILE` for elsewhere).

**`shotbox run [options] -- COMMAND...`** runs a command in a sealed session
and exits with its status. For scripts that take several pictures: inside,
`shotbox wait window|port|file|ready|stable ARG` and `shotbox capture OUT.png
[--window RE] [--crop G] [--park]` work on the session's display. `shotbox wait
stable [SECS] [--window RE]` is the one to use after a click, in place of a
sleep. A wait that gives up takes a picture of the screen with `--failed
FILE`, or wherever `$SHOTBOX_FAILED` says (`--env SHOTBOX_FAILED=...`).

Inside, `shotbox key CHORD...` presses keys (`ctrl+comma`, `Return`,
`alt+shift+Tab`), `shotbox type TEXT` types ASCII text, and `shotbox click
X Y`, `shotbox move X Y` and `shotbox drag X1 Y1 X2 Y2` work the pointer,
at a point on the screen or, with `--window RE`, inside a window (`click
--button 3`, `--double`). `shotbox park` moves the pointer to the screen's
bottom-right corner, off whatever it was hovering, and waits (up to
`--settle`, 2s) for the repaint; a screen that keeps changing is taken as it
is. They speak XTEST to the display directly, so there's still nothing to
install.

Both take the session options: `--screen WxH` (1280x800); `--env NAME=VALUE`
and `--pass NAME` to set or let through variables; `--seed DIR` to start the
home as a copy of a directory (a config, a profile, sample files);
`--desktop` for real GSettings and the system's D-Bus services, which a
desktop shell needs; `--system-bus` for a stand-in system bus; `--keep` to
keep the scratch dir and say where it is; `--wayland` and `--xwayland`
for a [Wayland](#wayland) session.

**`shotbox term [options] -- COMMAND...`** is a terminal to take pictures of:
VTE, the engine behind GNOME Terminal, Ptyxis and Tilix, in a plain window
named `shotbox-term`.

- `--scheme FILE` colors it: a Tilix scheme as is, or
  `{"foreground", "background", "cursor", "palette": [16 colors]}`.
- `--size COLSxROWS`, `--font "Monospace 11"`, `--title NAME`.
- Steps, in order: `--when REGEX` waits for the screen's text to match,
  `--type TEXT` types (`\r` is Enter, `\e` Escape), `--sleep SECS`. After
  the last one it writes the ready file. The terminal stays open, its
  screen as the program left it, after the program exits: no `sleep 60` to
  keep it up.
- `--crop COLSxROWS` takes only the top-left cells: a wide terminal, so
  nothing wraps, and a picture of just the part that matters. It writes
  the size in pixels to `$SHOTBOX_SCRATCH/crop`, which `shoot` crops to
  when it has no `--crop` of its own.
- `--shoot OUT.png` starts the session and takes the picture too, taking
  `shoot`'s session options, `--park` and `--failed`.
- `--log FILE` keeps every byte the program wrote, escape codes and all
  (via `script`, whose first line is its own header). Colors are hard to
  judge in a picture and easy to grep in the log.

```
shotbox term --shoot irssi.png --scheme dark.json --size 88x24 \
  --when 'End of /NAMES' --type 'hello\r' -- irssi -c 127.0.0.1
```

which is short for `shotbox shoot irssi.png --window shotbox-term --wait
ready -- shotbox term ...`.

**`shotbox compare A.png B.png [--diff D.png] [--fuzz 1%] [--max N]`**
counts the pixels that differ and fails if more than `--max` (0) do. With a
committed picture, that's a visual regression test.

**`shotbox compare REFDIR NEWDIR [NAME...]`** does that for each picture in
REFDIR (or each NAME), against the one of the same name in NEWDIR, a line
each, and fails if any differs, is missing, or changed size. `--diff DIR`
writes `NAME-diff.png` there for each that fails. `--fuzz` and `--max`
take `NAME=VALUE` for one picture, beside a plain VALUE for the rest:

```
shotbox compare data/screenshots fresh --fuzz 0.5% --fuzz video=5% --diff fresh
```

## Wayland

`--wayland` makes a session a Wayland one: the program runs under a
headless sway, drawing in software, instead of on Xvfb. `--xwayland` adds
an Xwayland to it, and `DISPLAY`, so an X client runs the way it does on a
Wayland desktop, GTK programs made to with `--env GDK_BACKEND=x11`.

```
shotbox shoot editor.png --wayland --window app=org.gnome.TextEditor -- gnome-text-editor
```

Everything else is the same: windows by title or `app=`, pictures, waits,
failure pictures, keys, text, the pointer, `park`, `term` and the Python
API (`shotbox.Session(wayland=True)`, or `here()` inside). Windows come
from sway's IPC socket and pictures from `grim`; keys and the pointer go
over sway's virtual keyboard and pointer, from a small client of
shotbox's own, as XTEST does on X11.

The pictures aren't X11's: GTK draws its own decorations on Wayland,
and under Xwayland, with no XSETTINGS, its text at 96 dpi. A committed
picture belongs to one backend.

Needs `sway` and `grim`, and `Xwayland` for `--xwayland`:
`sudo apt install sway grim xwayland`. Why sway, and how it fits:
[docs/wayland.md](docs/wayland.md).

## Python

A script that takes many pictures can drive the display itself rather than
start a `shotbox` process for every click. Inside `shotbox run`,
`shotbox.here()` is the session's display; outside, `shotbox.Session` starts
one. Both are a `Screen`:

```python
import shotbox

with shotbox.Session(size=(1600, 1000), failed="out/chat-failed.png") as s:
    s.spawn(["gtkhx"], log="gtkhx.log")
    s.wait_window("GtkHx.*")
    s.click(560, 660, window="GtkHx.*")
    s.type("/clear\n")
    s.wait_stable(window="GtkHx.*")
    s.capture("out/chat.png", window="GtkHx.*", park=True)
```

- Waits: `wait_window(re)` (a title, or `app=RE`; returns
  `(id, name, w, h, x, y)`),
  `wait_port(n)`, `wait_file(path)`, `wait_ready()`,
  `wait_stable(secs=0.5, window=None)`, and `until(what, test)` for a test
  of your own; each takes `timeout` (30).
- Input: `key(*chords)`, `type(text)`, `click(x, y, window=None,
  button=1, double=False)`, `move`, `drag`, `park()`. One X connection,
  kept.
- Pictures: `capture(out, window=None, crop=None, park=False)`, and
  `window(re)` for where one is.
- Anything that fails raises `SessionError`, saying what; with `failed` set
  (or `$SHOTBOX_FAILED` inside `shotbox run`) it leaves a picture of the
  screen there first, and says where.
- A `Session` also has `spawn(cmd, log=None)`, `run(cmd)`, `env` and
  `scratch`.

With a checkout, put its root on `PYTHONPATH` (`--pass PYTHONPATH` to let it
into a session).

## Node

`node/` is a small package for browser checks with Playwright, from the
pieces several projects had copied between them:

```js
import { serve, checks, pageErrors, launch, until, gif, sealed,
         dress, film, frames, steady } from 'shotbox';
```

- `serve(dir, port = 0)`: a static server on localhost that serves ES
  modules with the right type; port 0 picks a free one.
  `shotbox-serve [DIR] [PORT] [PAGE]` runs it by hand (port 8080) and
  prints the address of PAGE, for a site whose page isn't at its top:
  `"demo": "shotbox-serve . 8080 demo/"` in a project's scripts.
- `checks()`: `check(cond, what)` and `skip(what)` print `ok`, `FAIL` or
  `skip` lines; `done()` prints the tally and returns the exit status.
- `pageErrors(page)`: every uncaught exception and `console.error`.
- `launch(cmd, args)`: a program in its own process group, with `kill()`
  that reaches its children and `why()` that says how it ended and what it
  printed. `until(test, ms)` polls.
- `gif(film, out, { width, fps, from, colors, dither })`: a Playwright
  recording, or a directory from `frames()`, as a GIF, via ffmpeg, with its own palette. `from` cuts that
  many seconds off the start, `colors` caps the palette, and `dither` is
  ffmpeg's (`none` for flat pages with something moving on them).
- `sealed({ pass, env })`: an environment for a headless browser that
  nothing of yours gets into, as a session's but with no display.
  Otherwise Chromium's fonts come through your `~/.config/fontconfig` and
  `~/.local/share/fonts`, and your pictures aren't anybody else's. Give
  its `env` to `chromium.launch({ env })` and `close()` it afterwards.
  `pass` (a list of names) and `env` (an object) do what `--pass` and
  `--env` do.
- `dress(page, { hold })`: a pointer and captions for a recording, since
  a browser records neither its cursor nor a key pressed. A dot follows
  the mouse and shrinks while a button is down; `caption(text)` shows a
  caption at the bottom for `hold` ms (1300). Both come back after a
  reload; `remove()` takes them out for a still.
- `film(page)`: where the loop starts in a recording. Call it right after
  `newPage()`, `start()` when the loop begins, and `end()` closes the
  context and resolves to the video, for `gif(video, out, { from:
  reel.from })`. Playwright writes a frame only when the page repaints.

- `frames(page, { dir, fps, epoch, seed })`: a recording made a frame
  at a time that comes out the same each run, where `recordVideo` races
  the page and never does. The page's time stands still and moves a
  frame's worth between screenshots: timers, `Date`,
  `requestAnimationFrame`, CSS transitions and animations, and a seeded
  `Math.random`. Launch Chromium with `args: steady`, and call it before
  the page's first navigation. `run(ms)` lets page time pass unrecorded,
  `start()` starts keeping frames, `hold(ms)` stands in for
  `waitForTimeout` and `move(x, y, ms)` for `mouse.move({ steps })`;
  other input lands between frames. `end()` says where they are, for
  `gif(dir, out, { fps })`. Runs match frame for frame, give or take a
  few pixels one level apart; what is real-time and not a timer (a
  fetch, a worker, an iframe loading) is not stood still, though a
  frame that navigates is let load and paint before time moves on.

```js
const context = await browser.newContext({ recordVideo: { dir } });
const page = await context.newPage();
const reel = film(page);
await page.goto(url);
const dressing = await dress(page);
reel.start();
await page.mouse.move(400, 300, { steps: 24 });
await dressing.caption('Alt  Enter');
await page.keyboard.press('Alt+Enter');
await gif(await reel.end(), 'demo.gif', { from: reel.from });
```

It has TypeScript declarations, written by hand beside each module and
checked by `npm run types`. `dress`, `film` and `pageErrors` take
Playwright's `Page`, so they want Playwright's own types installed.

Its `package.json` is at the top of the repository, since npm installs
from the top of a git repository and nowhere else:
`"shotbox": "github:mishan/shotbox"` in `devDependencies`, or
`"file:../shotbox"` for a checkout beside yours.

## Tests

`test/run.sh` checks the session, the terminal, the pictures, the Python
API (`test/api.py`, which needs GTK 3's PyGObject) and the Node helpers, and
takes a few seconds. The helpers that need a browser use Playwright's
Chromium (`npm install && npx playwright install chromium`) and skip
without it, and the Wayland sessions need sway, grim and Xwayland and skip
without them.
